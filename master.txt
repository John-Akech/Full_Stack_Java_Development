This is the first file I created while learning Git!

So far, I have learned various Git commands, including:

1. I have learned how to install git
2. How to configure my credentials.
e.g., ``git config --global user.name <"your user name">
      ``git config --global user.email <your email address>
      ``git config --list: to check the credentials.
3. pwd
4. mkdir
5. ls
6. cd
7. touch
8. notepad <file>: to open a file on Notepad.
9. git status: to check the changes staged for commit.
10. git log: to display commit history of a repositry.
